Agent-Based Image Contrast Enhancement Algorithm
Recently, I worked on an Image Enhancement project where I implemented the Agent-Based Image Contrast Enhancement Algorithm using MATLAB. After thoroughly understanding the algorithm, I translated its principles into MATLAB code to enhance image contrast effectively.

The core idea behind this approach is to utilize agent-based techniques to adaptively adjust the contrast, preserving image details while improving visibility. During the implementation, I focused on optimizing the algorithm for different types of images and analyzed its performance using various image quality metrics. The results demonstrated significant improvement in contrast and detail preservation compared to traditional enhancement methods.

This project deepened my understanding of image processing techniques and MATLAB programming while reinforcing my interest in signal processing and image enhancement technologies.
